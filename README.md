# Interchain Accounts

> Interchain accounts allows a IBC-connected foreign blockchain to 
> send a transaction via the local account of the a local blockchain.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code to operate an IBC interchain account as specified in [Interchain Standards 27](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-027-interchain-accounts). Please refer to the ICS27 specification for technical details on how interchain accounts work. Current implementation supports interchain accounts on the Cosmos-SDK implementation of ICS27. For information on use-cases of interchain accounts, please refer to this [introductory blogpost](https://medium.com/chainapsis/why-interchain-accounts-change-everything-for-cosmos-interoperability-59c19032bf11).

## Demo Build

Use the [demo branch](https://github.com/chainapsis/cosmos-sdk-interchain-account/tree/demo) to build the interchain accounts demo.

Instructions on how to build can be found [here](https://github.com/chainapsis/cosmos-sdk-interchain-account/blob/demo/demo.md).
